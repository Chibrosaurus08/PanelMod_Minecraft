# PanelMod_Minecraft
Hello everyone

To play my mod you must go to the neoforge website change the version to download the 1.21.8 version. 
this is the website link : https://neoforged.net

After this you must go to Minecraft and create a new version with the neoforge 1.21.8.
and then you launch the game one time then you go back to your desk. 

you press windows+R and you write %appdata% and then you go to .minecraft and then you go to mods and you drag and drop my mod. 

Windows+R --> %appdata% --> .minecraft  --> mods --> Drag and Drop "mod-1.0.0-neoforge-1.21.8.jar"

And you launch your minecraft neoforge 1.21.8 and you have the mod !

Thank you for your listening
